PandaStack Todo List

Todo List:
* If module is a service, and invalid or no service name is specified, causing program to hang or throw up
	PandaStack should properly handle it with an error, then not allow control to that module, since it's "inactive" or "broken"
+ Add support for programs and languages
	Programs: should be active only while PandaStack is active
+ Abiltiy to manage services?
+ Configuration of pandastack?
+ Document the code
