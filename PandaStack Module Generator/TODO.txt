The PandaStack Module Generator is an addition to the PandaStack core,
that allows you to easily manage the module for the PandaStack.

The PandaStack configuration file uses JSON, so this simple addon
should be able to load that file, and be able to manage it.

TODO:
+ Create new/load exisiting configurtion file
+ Save/output the config
+ Test configuration?
	* Load the config, test to make sure it's valid, test to make sure the
		modules work, etc etc
